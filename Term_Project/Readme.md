# Project Description
Your task is that given historical data of daily revenue from different restaurants in Uppsala you are to predict future sales.  You are given raw unprocessed data, before you will be able to use an algorithm in scikit-learn you will have to do some processing on data field.  You are free to use any algorithm from the course or not.  Your goal in the project is to compare a number of algorithms and preprocessing methods to see how well they compare. 

This project is as much about feature extraction and pre-processing and machine learning. Some ideas that you could try:

Use information on public holidays (red days) in Sweden. It is possible to get Swedish public holidays as CSV files hereLinks to an external site.
* Different ways of converting the date values to a format useful for my machine learning algorithm? 
* There are a lot of techniques for time series forecastingLinks to an external site.   that we do not cover in the course. You should think of this feature extraction, and you should try different methods and see how they compare.
* Another idea is to use weather data. An open source of weather data can be found hereLinks to an external site.. 
* You are free to use any external data sources. 
* The data has a column with a column that identifies the restaurant. Is it better to train one model that predicts for any restaurant? Or a number of separate  models for each restaurant.
